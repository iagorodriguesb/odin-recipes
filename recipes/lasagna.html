        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <LI>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</LI>
            <LI>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water.</LI>
            <LI>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Whisk in flour until lightly browned and onion is tender, about 2 minutes. Add chicken broth, milk, and salt; cook, whisking continuously, for 1 minute.</LI>
            <LI>Stir in 2 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan until well combined. Season with basil, oregano, and black pepper; remove from heat and set aside.</LI>
            <LI>Spread 1/3 of the sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, ricotta, and chicken. Arrange 3 lasagna noodles over the chicken and layer with 1/3 of the sauce mixture, spinach, remaining 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 cup Parmesan. Arrange remaining noodles over cheese and spread remaining sauce evenly over noodles. Sprinkle with parsley and remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan.</LI>
            <LI>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes.</LI>
        </ol>
